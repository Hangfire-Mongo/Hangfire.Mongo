### *** BREAKING CHANGES FOR v0.4.0 *** (v0.4.0)
- Combined collections for state data into one collection
- Optimized job creation
  - Not getting timestamp from mongodb. Using Datetime.UtcNow
  - Using MongoDB native "ObjectId" as JobId instead of int.

### Why did you do this?
We currently have issues regarding atomicity in our "JobStorageTransaction" implemention. 
In order to address this we are combining this information into one collection in order to do bulk writes.

### What should I do?
You have to drop your jobs db.
